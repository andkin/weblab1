      If you'd like to run an event for our Big Birthday Weekend, please head over to the Big Birthday Weekend 2019 page and join our newsletter. That's where we'll provide updates on what's going on and what you need to do to join in.

If this sounds like it might be your kind of thing, but you've never done it before, there's plenty of time to get off to a gentle start and run a Jam before 2018 is out. When you join the newsletter, we'll invite you to our Jam maker Slack community, where you can get support from us and from wonderful Jam makers all around the world. They have lots of help and advice to offer people who are just starting out with their first Jam, and you'll be well rehearsed by the time the birthday weekend comes around.
