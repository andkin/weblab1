		<p><font size="5" color="black" face="kelt">In this tutorial, we'll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.
You can see what we'll be building here: Final Result. If the code doesn't make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with the code's syntax, don't worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.
We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you'll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game's board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and is updated as the game progresses.
You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you're familiar with it. We'll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.</p>

We'll also assume that you're familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.
If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading this guide. Note that we're also using some features from ES6 — a recent version of JavaScript. In this tutorial, we're using arrow functions, classes, let, and const statements. You can use the Babel REPL to check what ES6 code compiles to.</p>

		<p><font size="5" color="yellow" face="kelt">React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.We'll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.
Here, ShoppingList is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.
The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write. The  syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div').</p>

		<p><font size="5" color="green" face="kelt">If you're going to work on the tutorial in your browser, open this code in a new tab: Starter Code. If you're going to work on the tutorial locally, instead open src/index.js in your project folder (you have already touched this file during the setup).
This Starter Code is the base of what we're building. We've provided the CSS styling so that you only need focus on learning React and programming the tic-tac-toe game.
By inspecting the code, you'll notice that we have three React components:
Square
Board
Game
The Square component renders a single and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we'll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.</p>
